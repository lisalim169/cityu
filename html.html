<h2>The Positive Benefits associated with English Pinyin</h2>
<h3> <u> English Pinyin is a systematic combination of English IPA (International Phonetics Association) and Chinese Hanyu Pinyin</u></h3>
<h3> Research shows that Chinese Pinyin can positively influence English phonetic learning for Chinese students. Pinyin, as a phonetic system, helps learners develop phonological awareness, which is crucial for reading and pronouncing English words. Many Chinese students use Pinyin to approximate English pronunciation, and this transfer can boost their confidence and interest in English learning, especially at the beginner level. However, differences between English and Chinese sounds mean that some pronunciation errors may occur if Pinyin is over-relied upon.</h3>

 <h1>About Lisa Lim Xin Quan &gt;.&lt;</h1>
<div class="column_2">
    <div class="left">
    <p><h3>Hi! I'm Lisa Lim Xin Quan, a Year 3 Business (Real Estate) student at City University of Hong Kong. I'm an exchange student from the National University of Singapore, and I joined this class to fulfil credits for my minor in communications back home. </h3>
        <h3>I created this website as part of my Electronic Publishing coursework. I love learning new things and sharing knowledge with others, which is why I started YingYin Academy to help Chinese speakers improve their English pronunciation - it's also to help my baby cousin back in Fujian. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places in Hong Kong and taking the train around China. </h3>
        <h3>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect! I'm also looking for group mates for the group project &gt;.&lt;</h3></p>
